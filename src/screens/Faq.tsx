        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              Projects eligible for the Public Goods small grants rounds have a broader scope that benefits the entire
              Ethereum or Web3 space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Applicable projects should not be ENS-specific but may include ENS functionality. An example is ethers.js,
              a developer library that has utility throughout Web3, not only for those building with ENS.

            <p>
              Projects eligible for the Ecosystem small grants rounds are those that build on or improve the ENS
              Ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Applicable projects are meaningfully building, creating content, or improving the ENS ecosystem. An
              example is ENSfairy.xyz, an ENS name-gifting tool that adds explicit functionality to the ENS ecosystem.
